ELECTRICITY CONSUMPTION: TRANSITION TO RENEWABLES AND KEY INFLUENCING FACTORS

Group Members: Mohsen Farrokhrouz, Shweta Jain, Oliver King

Research Questions:
    1. Will renewable sources account for more than 50% of electricity production by 2050?
    2. Does temperature have a significant influence on electricity consumption?
    3. Does wealth (GDP per capita) have a significant influence on electricity consumption?

Approach to Answering Research Questions:

    - Provide initial overview of electricity production and consumption, by generation type, for a range of countries/regions/continents.

    1. Forecast electricity production, by generation type, for each country.
        - using time based machine learning model (e.g. ARIMA, KMeans, linear regression)
    2. Analyse relationship between average temperature of a country and electricity consumption per capita.
        - which ML model to use???
    3. Analyse relationship between GDP per capita and electricity consumption per capita.
        - which ML model to use???
