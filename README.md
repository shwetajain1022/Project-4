# GENERATING ELECTRICITY: RENEWABLES & NON-RENEWABLES

# Group Members: Shweta Jain, Mohsen Farrokhrouz, Oliver King

# Research Questions:
    1. What proportion of electricity generation will renewable sources account for by 2025?
    2. Does wealth (GDP per capita) have a significant influence on electricity consumption?
    3. What is the outlook for solar-based electricity generation in Australia (to 2025)? 

# Approach to Answering Research Questions:
     - Provide initial overview of electricity production and consumption, by generation type, for a range of countries/regions/continents.
        (Tableau dashboard)
# 
     1. Forecast electricity production separately for renewables and non-renewables.
        - using time-series machine-learning model from ARIMA family (e.g. ARMA, ARIMA, SARIMA).
     2. Analyse relationship between GDP per capita and electricity consumption per capita.
        - user able to investigate this phenomenon on interactive Tableau dashbaord.

# Presentation of Data:
    - Tableau:
        - The findings of the research (or answers to the research questions) will be presented using an interactive Tableau Dashboard.
        - Charts included in Tableau Dashboard:
            1. Global map with mouseover function that shows electricity production data for user selected country.
            2. Total/aggregate electricity production (by generation-type) for user selected country. Users will be able to contrast and compare the make-up of electricity generation-types for different countries.
            3. Historical breakdown of renewable and non-renewable electricity generation for user selected country.
            4. Presentation of relationship between energy consumption per-capita and GDP per-capita for user selected country
#    - Power Point:
        - A power point presentation will be used to highlight the data analysis techniques and processes the team undertook, as well as outlining the platforms used and detail the machine-learning models implemented and results produced.

# Instructions for Running ML Models in Google Colab:
    1. Upload notebook from 'AI Modelling' folder to Google Colab
    2. Click the 'Files' icon on left of screen, then right click in sidebar and select 'New Folder' to create a new folder.
    3. Name this new folder 'model_data'
    4. Copy 'energyconsumptiongdppopulation.csv' from the 'FinalModelCSV' folder and paste it in the recently created 'model_data' folder.
    5. Once the csv has uploaded, the data should read in (second cell block) and model should run without error.

# Navigating the Repository:

 - Repository URL: https://github.com/shwetajain1022/Project-4.git

# - Files in home directory:
    1. '.gitignore'
        - file to protect password used to access database via SQLAlchemy.
    2. 'electricity_model.ipynb'
        - SQLAlchemy engine to access and query locally hosted database.
    3. 'population_gdp.ipynb'
        - Jupyter notebook used to read in csv data, clean and transform the data, then export to csv.
    4. 'README.md'
        - This file, outlining contents of repository and project details.
# - Folders/Directories:
    1. 'AI Modelling':
        - includes 4 x notebooks to be run in Google Colab.
        - each notebook runs an ARIMA-family time-series model on a different dataset, including:
            a. non-renewable electricity production: global
            b. renewable electricity production: global
            c. solar electricity production: australia
            d. renewable and non-renewable production: australia
        - Instructions for running ML models can be found above, under "Instructions for Running ML Models in Google Colab" sub-heading.
#    2. 'Database Models':
        - 'electricity_db.sql': script used to create tables for SQL database for storage of data.
        - 'QuickDBD-EnergyConsumption.png': Entity relationship diagram used to develop SQL database format.
#    3. 'FinalModelCSV':
        - includes 5 x csv files that are the output of the data-cleansing and transformation process undertaken in 'population_gdp.ipynb'.
        - these 5 csv's were then imported into the database 'electricity_db.sql'.
#    4. 'Presentation':
